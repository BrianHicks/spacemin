# Spacemin

A ground-up `.emacs.d` with just stuff I like from Spacemacs.
Likely not useful for anyone else.

## Installing

1. Install this repo as your `.emacs.d`.
2. Start emacs. Wait a while while watching the blinkenlights in the message line.
3. Probably restart it or whatever, I don't care.
4. You've won. Go to Disneyland?
