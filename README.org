* Spacemin

A ground-up ~.emacs.d~ with just stuff I like from Spacemacs.
Likely not useful for anyone else.

** Installing

1. Install this repo as your ~.emacs.d`~
2. Start emacs. Wait a while while watching the blinkenlights in the message line.
3. Probably restart it or whatever, I don't care.
4. You've won. Go to Disneyland?
   
** TODOs

*** DONE evil
*** DONE magit
*** TODO ~<SPC>fs~
*** TODO which-key
*** TODO ~<SPC>w~ prefix
*** TODO projectile and perspectives
*** TODO ivy or smex or something
*** TODO better fonts and themes. And a theme switcher would be super nice too.
*** TODO ~<SPC>1~ through ~9~ for window jumps?
*** TODO nice bindings for making stuff with make
*** TODO a shell, maybe? Probably not though.
*** TODO hide the top bar, I don't really need it.
*** TODO compile everything to byte code to avoid long startup times
*** TODO go over the default Cask packages and add them as needed
